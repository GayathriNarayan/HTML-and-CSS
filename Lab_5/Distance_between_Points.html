<!-- 8. Distance between Points
Write a JS function that calculates the distance between two points by given x and y coordinates. Use objects to store the two points.
The input comes as array of four string elements in the format [x1, y1, x2, y2] that need to be parsed as numbers. Each pair of elements are the coordinates of a point in 2D space.
The output should be returned as a result of your function.

Examples Input Output
Input = ['2', '4', '5', '0']  Output = 5

Input = ['2.34', '15.66', '-13.55', '-2.9985']  Output = 24.50778901186315
